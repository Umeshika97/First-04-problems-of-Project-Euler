# First-04-problems-of-Project-Euler
In the current world, numerical analysis is evolved by using computer codes to solve advanced
numerical problems which are difficult to solve manually. And also, numerical analysis is the 
combination of mathematics and computer science that is used algorithms for advanced
mathematical calculation. Furthermore, the mathematical methods that were found by 
mathematicians or physicists can be implemented step by step using an algorithm. In the 18th 
century, Sir Leonhard Euler was a Swiss mathematician who has introduced the numerical 
method for complex analysis, infinitesimal calculus, and graph theory. Not only that he was 
introduced the mathematical notation and function as well. Furthermore, the free website of the 
Project Euler was launched in 2001 including 666 and more questions by Colin Hughes including 
numerical calculating problems. In addition, Project Euler is provided with a platform for learning 
numerical calculation using programming skills. This report is mainly based on the solution of the 
first 04 problems of Project Euler that were solved by using the high-level programming language
of Python 03.


Python 03 is an object-oriented scripting language, and it has been easy to understand. Currently,
python 03 is used in a lot of computational areas because it is utilized familiar English syntaxes 
which are easy to understand and learn. Not only that it is free to open software, and everyone 
can download it freely. And also, python has standard libraries which can import and get the 
output easily. There are the vital benefits of learning python that has allowed debugging of 
snippets of code and interactive testing. There are various fundamental packages are used for 
numerical calculation and graphical representation such as NumPy and matplotlib.
